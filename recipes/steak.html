    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My variation of an old Southern Living recipe - a double recipe will fill
      a Dutch oven and make plenty for an extended family dinner.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>

      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>

      <li>1 (14 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes</li>

      <li>2 cups water</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

      <li>7 ounces whole wheat spaghetti</li>

      <li>Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef,
        onion, and garlic until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is
        translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, oregano, and
        black pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and let simmer,
        stirring often, for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Break spaghetti into thirds and add to the pot; cover and simmer,
        stirring often, until pasta is tender, about 20 minutes. Serve topped
        with Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
